##WHICH DATABASE I SHOULD USE

- MongoDB can be a database to store Go struct objects serialized into JSON.
- Or use encoding/json package to marshal/unmarshal Go struct objects stored on etcd.
- Or use ovsdb with some libraries I wrote for [neutron-lan](https://github.com/araobp/neutron-lan).
- [tega](https://github.com/araobp/tega) is the most suitable database to satisfy my requirements, but it was written in Python (consumes a lot of memory, dependent on Tornado) and it has not been completed yet...
- [mergo](https://github.com/imdario/mergo) is a very interesting Golang package. I think I can develop a simple tega-like database with this.
- OpenDaylight's MD-SAL datastore is perfect, but it is for Java only, its Java binding codes generated by the YANG tools are too complicated and bulky, and I would use Docker Container with Kubernetes rather than OSGi.

##Conclusion

- ovsdb just to fetch a port number of VXLAN tunnel (read-only).
- etcd just to store host IP addresses of Docker containers.
- develop a new database with mergo to store JSON data (YANG as its schema lang)

##New database to be developed
- Merge(add/delete) operations with mergo
- Commits Log and periodic snapshots onto a storage

###Schema generation
```
[YANG schema]--->[protobuf]--->[pb.go(go struct)]
```

###Data flow
```
          Master                                Agent                    
--------------------------              ----------------------------------------
