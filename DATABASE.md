##DATABASE

- MongoDB can be a database to store Go struct objects serialized into JSON.
- Or use encoding/json package to marshal/unmarshal Go struct objects stored on etcd.
- Or use ovsdb with some libraries I wrote for [neutron-lan](https://github.com/araobp/neutron-lan).
- [tega](https://github.com/araobp/tega) is the most suitable database to satisfy my requirements, but it was written in Python (consumes a lot of memory, dependent on Tornado) and it has not been completed yet...
- OpenDaylight's MD-SAL datastore is perfect, but it is for Java only, its Java binding codes generated by the YANG tools are too complicated and bulky, and I would use Docker Container with Kubernetes rather than OSGi.

I will test MongoDB and etcd first:
- Check if it supports "partial update" of JSON data.
- Check if it supports data change notification.

I know that MongoDB does not support such data change notification feature, but a combination of etcd (instead of ZooKeeper) and MongoDB might also be interesting...

BUT, for the time being, I will use etcd only with etcd's "CreateInOrder" API to add/delete an element to/from a list, although that is not a perfect "partial update".
